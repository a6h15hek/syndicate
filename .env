# --- Advanced Speech Recognition Settings ---

# RECOGNIZER_SAMPLE_RATE: The sample rate for the audio stream in Hz.
# This should match the training data of your Vosk model (16000Hz is standard for most).
# DESCRIPTION: Sets the audio quality. Do not change unless you are using a specific model that requires it.
RECOGNIZER_SAMPLE_RATE=16000

# NOISE_CALIBRATION_DURATION: The number of seconds to listen for ambient noise at startup.
# This helps the system establish a baseline for what to consider "silence."
# DESCRIPTION: Duration in seconds for initial ambient noise assessment. 2-3 seconds is usually sufficient.
NOISE_CALIBRATION_DURATION=2

# VAD_AGGRESSIVENESS: How aggressively the Voice Activity Detection (VAD) filters out non-speech.
# Must be an integer between 0 and 3.
# 0: Least aggressive. Good for quiet environments.
# 3: Most aggressive. Good for noisy environments, but may clip speech.
# DESCRIPTION: Controls the sensitivity of speech detection. Start with 1 and increase if background noise is an issue.
VAD_AGGRESSIVENESS=1

# SILENCE_THRESHOLD: Seconds of silence to consider a phrase complete.
# THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SETTING FOR CONVERSATION FLOW.
# HIGHER VALUE (e.g., 2.0-3.0): Allows for longer pauses mid-sentence. Better for thoughtful, natural conversation.
# LOWER VALUE (e.g., 1.0-1.5): More responsive, but may cut you off if you pause to think.
# DESCRIPTION: The duration of silence (in seconds) that marks the end of an utterance.
SILENCE_THRESHOLD=2.5

# PHRASE_TIMEOUT: Maximum seconds for a single phrase before forcing a result.
# This is a safety net to prevent the recognizer from listening indefinitely.
# DESCRIPTION: The maximum time (in seconds) allowed for a single continuous spoken phrase.
PHRASE_TIMEOUT=15.0
