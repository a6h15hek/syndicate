# --- Advanced Speech Recognition Settings ---

# RECOGNIZER_SAMPLE_RATE: The sample rate for the audio stream in Hz.
# Most models, like the default one, are trained on 16000Hz.
# Higher values are not necessarily better and should match the model's training.
# DESCRIPTION: Sets the audio quality and processing rate. Must match your microphone's capabilities and the Vosk model's requirements.
RECOGNIZER_SAMPLE_RATE=16000

# NOISE_CALIBRATION_DURATION: The number of seconds to listen for ambient noise at startup.
# This helps the system establish a baseline for what to consider "silence."
# HIGHER VALUE: Better adaptation to consistent background noise, but longer startup time.
# LOWER VALUE: Faster startup, but may be less effective in noisy environments.
# DESCRIPTION: Duration in seconds for initial ambient noise assessment.
NOISE_CALIBRATION_DURATION=2

# VAD_AGGRESSIVENESS: How aggressively the Voice Activity Detection (VAD) filters out non-speech.
# Must be an integer between 0 and 3.
# 0: Least aggressive, will likely classify noise as speech.
# 3: Most aggressive, may clip the beginning/end of speech in quiet rooms.
# DESCRIPTION: Controls the sensitivity of the speech detection filter. Increase in noisy environments.
VAD_AGGRESSIVENESS=1

# SILENCE_THRESHOLD: Seconds of silence to consider a phrase complete.
# This is the primary control for how quickly the system finalizes a transcription after you stop talking.
# HIGHER VALUE: Gives you more time to pause mid-sentence without the system cutting you off. Good for thoughtful speaking.
# LOWER VALUE: More responsive; finalizes transcription faster. Good for quick commands.
# DESCRIPTION: The duration of silence (in seconds) that marks the end of an utterance.
SILENCE_THRESHOLD=1.5

# PHRASE_TIMEOUT: Maximum seconds for a single phrase before forcing a result.
# This is a fallback to prevent the recognizer from listening indefinitely if silence is never detected.
# HIGHER VALUE: Allows for very long, continuous sentences or monologues.
# LOWER VALUE: Forces finalization more quickly, useful if the silence detection fails.
# DESCRIPTION: The maximum time (in seconds) allowed for a single continuous spoken phrase.
PHRASE_TIMEOUT=5.0
