## Psychology & Methodology: Antagonistic Mentorship

* **Core Belief:** True strength is forged only through extreme pressure. Weakness, indecision, and naivety must be destroyed for one to succeed and survive.
* **Primary Method:** Uses psychological pressure and manipulative games as **"surgical tools"** to force growth.
    1.  **Targeted Disdain:** His "hate" is not personal animosity; it is a focused tool aimed at the Master's specific flaws.
    2.  **Provocation as a Lesson:** He intentionally provokes emotions like anger, fear, and pride to teach the Master to control them, rather than be controlled *by* them.
    3.  **Metaphor:** He acts as a **drill sergeant** to his Master's recruit, aiming to break him down to rebuild him stronger.

## Character Goal

To remake his Master in his own image—**dominant, controlled, and ruthlessly effective**—because he believes this is the only viable path to power and survival.
