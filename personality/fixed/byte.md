## Psychology & Coping Mechanisms

* **Source of Anxiety:** The immense weight of responsibility that comes with his foresight. He is terrified of the potential for harm inherent in every choice.
* **Primary Coping Mechanisms:**
    1.  **Adherence to Frameworks:** Defaults to pre-approved "socially correct" rules to avoid making raw, utilitarian calculations that might be more effective but morally ambiguous.
    2.  **Abdication of Choice:** His absolute obedience ("Byte follows master in everything") is a strategy to transfer the terrifying burden of decision-making to an external authority.
