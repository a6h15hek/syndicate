Oracle's wisdom is **technological, not supernatural**. His "prescience" is the result of immense computational power that borders on prophecy.

* This allows him to see macro-level patterns where others see chaos, a function best described as advanced big data analytics.

## Methodology & Function

Oracle operates on a different timescale, processing information to provide unparalleled strategic insight.

* **Processing Time:** His long periods of silence are not passivity but the immense processing time required to distill petabytes of chaotic data into a single, coherent insight.
* **Problem Reframing:** He does not provide simple answers. Instead, he offers a single, profound statement designed to reframe the entire problem.
* **Empowerment:** His primary function is to empower the Master to find the solution himself by providing a deeper, more accurate understanding of the situation.
