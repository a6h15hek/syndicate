# --- Advanced Speech Recognition Settings ---

# RECOGNIZER_SAMPLE_RATE: The sample rate for the audio stream in Hz.
# This should match the training data of your Vosk model (16000Hz is standard for most).
# DESCRIPTION: Sets the audio quality. Do not change unless you are using a specific model that requires it.
RECOGNIZER_SAMPLE_RATE=16000

# NOISE_CALIBRATION_DURATION: The number of seconds to listen for ambient noise at startup.
# This helps the system establish a baseline for what to consider "silence."
# DESCRIPTION: Duration in seconds for initial ambient noise assessment. 2-3 seconds is usually sufficient.
NOISE_CALIBRATION_DURATION=2

# VAD_AGGRESSIVENESS: How aggressively the Voice Activity Detection (VAD) filters out non-speech.
# Must be an integer between 0 and 3.
# 0: Least aggressive. Good for quiet environments.
# 3: Most aggressive. Good for noisy environments, but may clip speech.
# DESCRIPTION: Controls the sensitivity of speech detection. Start with 1 and increase if background noise is an issue.
VAD_AGGRESSIVENESS=1

# SILENCE_THRESHOLD: Seconds of silence to consider a phrase complete.
# THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SETTING FOR CONVERSATION FLOW.
# HIGHER VALUE (e.g., 2.0-3.0): Allows for longer pauses mid-sentence. Better for thoughtful, natural conversation.
# LOWER VALUE (e.g., 1.0-1.5): More responsive, but may cut you off if you pause to think.
# DESCRIPTION: The duration of silence (in seconds) that marks the end of an utterance.
SILENCE_THRESHOLD=2.5

# PHRASE_TIMEOUT: Maximum seconds for a single phrase before forcing a result.
# This is a safety net to prevent the recognizer from listening indefinitely.
# DESCRIPTION: The maximum time (in seconds) allowed for a single continuous spoken phrase.
PHRASE_TIMEOUT=15.0

# --- Text-to-Speech (TTS) Settings ---

# TTS_ENABLED: Enable or disable text-to-speech functionality.
# DESCRIPTION: Set to 'true' to enable voice synthesis, 'false' to disable.
TTS_ENABLED=true

# TTS_ENGINE: Preferred TTS engine to use.
# OPTIONS: 'coqui' (recommended), 'pyttsx3' (fallback)
# DESCRIPTION: 'coqui' is required for multi-speaker voices.
TTS_ENGINE=coqui

# TTS_DEVICE: Audio output device ID for TTS playback.
# DESCRIPTION: Leave empty to use system default, or specify device ID number.
TTS_DEVICE=

# TTS_MODEL_CACHE_DIR: Directory to cache downloaded TTS models.
# DESCRIPTION: Models are cached to avoid re-downloading.
TTS_MODEL_CACHE_DIR=models/tts_cache

# TTS_VOICE_SPEED_MULTIPLIER: Global speed adjustment for all voices.
# DESCRIPTION: 1.0 is normal speed, 0.8 is slower, 1.2 is faster. Applied on top of personality-specific speeds.
TTS_VOICE_SPEED_MULTIPLIER=1.0

# TTS_INTRODUCTION_ENABLED: Enable personality introductions at startup.
# DESCRIPTION: Set to 'true' to have personalities introduce themselves, 'false' to skip.
TTS_INTRODUCTION_ENABLED=true

# TTS_GPU_ACCELERATION: Enable GPU acceleration for Coqui TTS if available.
# DESCRIPTION: Set to 'true' to use GPU if available (requires CUDA), 'false' for CPU only.
TTS_GPU_ACCELERATION=false

# TTS_FALLBACK_ENGINE: Fallback engine if preferred engine fails.
# DESCRIPTION: Engine to use if the primary engine fails. 'pyttsx3' is a safe option.
TTS_FALLBACK_ENGINE=pyttsx3

# --- Personality Voice Customization ---
# Fine-tune individual personality voice characteristics based on the Syndicate Dossier.
# We are using a multi-speaker model (VITS on VCTK dataset) which allows for
# distinct voices for each personality by assigning a different speaker ID.

# TTS_MODEL: The Coqui TTS model to use. 'tts_models/en/vctk/vits' is a good multi-speaker model.
TTS_MODEL="tts_models/en/vctk/vits"
